A tape demo for the Amstrad CPC. Features a base transfer rate of 2688 baud
or 336 characters per second, but also features in-place decompression so
the actual transfer rate is often much higher in practice.

It started as an experiment to use floppy disk style GCR encoding on normal
casette tape, although several earlier attempts were unreliable on a real
tape.

The easiest way to showcase the loading speed seemed to be loading lots of
images, each "delta" image is actually sending the entire screen, but the
compression engine can see the previous image and avoid re-encoding the same
sections again.

The artwork was created primarily by two people - JulijanaM, who created
"Lightkeeper" (the first sequence with the girl) and the rose, and Rexbeng
who created "Bin Renderin", the terminator style image.

This is JulijanaM's first oldskool work, and I'm sure you'll agree the results
are fantastic! You can see the original image she created and with the rest
of her artwork here:

Rexbeng is a long time CPC scener, and his sequence makes fantastic use of
mode 0 - the 16 colour mode on the Amstrad CPC.

The music (use all of the tunes!) was created by McKlain, and awesome CPC
musician who gets some amazing noises out of the AY-8192! You can hear more
of his work and the original non-chiptune version of Little Sailor here:
